This app is still in the initial development stages.  If you would like to contribute to this project please let me know.

This is a fork from the Google I/O 2011 app.  My goal is to have this app compatible with all android platforms, phones and tablets. The iosched app lays a great framework to build off of, as it has been well designed for all platforms, and operates very eficiently.

My first task is to refactor the app and prep it as a platform for my kegbot app.

The kegbot app will make use of the kegbot web API.  I would like to have features in the app that make use of all the API calls, such as drinks, kegs, sessions, temp readings...

If you have any other suggestions as to what features the app should have please post as well.
